### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Ase airtable api from airtable account
- Render data on page 
- Render an interactive inventory form from said data
- Create an update button for the inventory form
- Add an "add to iventory" form that adds data to the page and airtable
- Add a "log" tab to log data
- Make pretty with CSS

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add a search bar
- CSS animations
- Use a CSS library like Bootstrap

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Oct 8-9| Prompt / Wireframes / Component Heirarchy / Timeframes / Approval / PsuedoCode| Incomplete
|Oct 10| HTML/React Components | Incomplete
|Oct 11| React Components / AirTable API | Incomplete
|Oct 12| React Components | Incomplete
|Oct 13| Initial Updateable Model  | Incomplete
|Oct 14| MVP | Incomplete
|Oct 15| Post MVP| Incomplete
|Oct 16| Presentations | Incomplete

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 6hrs| 6hrs | 6hrs |
| HTML | H | 3hrs| 2hrs | 2hrs |
| React Components | H | 10hrs| 9hrs | 9hrs |
| CSS| H | 9hrs| 10hrs |  10hrs|
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 3hrs | 3hrs |
| JavaScript| H | 7hrs| 7hrs |7hrs |
| Total | H | 38hrs| 40hrs | 40hrs |

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: Design

### Weaknesses: Logic

### Opportunities: Develop more skills and comfort with React, JavaScript, and CSS

### Threats: Feeling inadequate which leads to stress.
